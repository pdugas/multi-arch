# Multi-Arch Builds

This is a test/demo project where I'm working out how to build and package a binary executable for multiple architectures.

### To Do

* ~~Simple example binary and Maekfile.~~
* ~~Add `DOCKER_LOGIN` and `DOCKER_TOKEN` secrets.~~
* ~~Unit test~~
* ~~Workflow to build, test, and publish binary artifact.~~
* ~~Add version and tag.~~
* ~~Extend workflow to build and publish Docker image.~~
